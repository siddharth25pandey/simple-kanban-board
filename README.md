# Simple kanban board 
This is a simple kanban app for learning purposes. A Kanban board is one of the tools that can be used to implement Kanban to manage work at a personal or organizational level. They visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. This app makes it easier to learn them.
